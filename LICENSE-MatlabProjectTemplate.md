MatlabProjectTemplate is multi-licensed under all of the following licenses:

* BSD 3-Clause License
* BSD 2-Clause License
* Apache License
* MIT License
* GPLv3

The main LICENSE file in this repo is the BSD 3-Clause License (instead of a note about multi-licensing) so that GitHub can auto-detect it and display it on the repo web page, and it's easy for MathWorks File Exchange to automatically determine license compatibility. The BSD 3-Clause License was chosen because that is the standard license required by MathWorks File Exchange.
